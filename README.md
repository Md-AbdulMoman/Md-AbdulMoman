### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My Name is Md. Abdul Moman.
#### Undergraduate Student of Chemistry | Research Enthusiast

I am currently pursuing a chemistry undergraduate degree.I am also gaining experience as a chemistry tutor at a tutoring center where i teach students in general chemistry topics including atomic structure and theories, quantum number and electronic configuration, periodic properties, chemical bonding and molecular shape, thermochemistry, chemical and acid-base equilibria, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, organic chemistry and environmental chemistry for College and High School students. I have experiences on conducting classes for small group of students, grading their tests, posting their grade, providing them feedback, preparing them for lab experiments and monitoring their progress."
